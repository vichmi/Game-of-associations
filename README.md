#Game of associations
Very funny game to play with friends. You choose several categories and every player should write a word(or a sentance) for each category(players before the start discuss the categories). After that the app chooses a player who should take the phone and explain the word he reads. If his team guessed the word he clicks on the tick button, if the team struggles he can pass to the next word from the button "x". 
The player has 60 seconds after that the other team is on turn. After all words has been gussed the next round starts where the player should explain what he sees with only 1 word. After that is the third round where he should explain the word using mimics. When all words has been guesssed there is a scoreboard with each team and their score.
